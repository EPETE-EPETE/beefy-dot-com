In the dynamic realm of Web 3.0, community-driven projects are reshaping the future of DeFi. Among these pioneers stands Mode, an OP Stack Layer 2 (**L2**) solution designed to foster growth and incentivize developers and protocols within the ecosystem.
 
### Innovative Incentives for Sustainable Growth
 
Mode stands out for its innovative approach to incentivization. It offers contract revenue-sharing incentives at the protocol layer, ensuring that applications and users who contribute to the growth of the Mode blockchain directly benefit from network sequencer profits. This approach not only encourages the development and scaling of blockchain applications but also aligns incentives across the ecosystem.
 
### Introducing Sequencer Fee Sharing and Developer Incentives
 
Mode's economic model revolves around creating a cooperative environment where contributions are monetarily rewarded. Developers can earn a portion of transaction fees through sequencer fee sharing, which are allocated among developers based on ongoing analysis of all deployed contracts on the chain.
 
### A Thriving DeFi Ecosystem
 
By helping developer activity with low operational costs, Mode addresses key barriers in decentralized application development. The platform's commitment to building a DeFi ecosystem is evident in its strategic growth initiatives.
 
We at Beefy aim to partner with teams who share the same vision as us for a robust, strong DeFi ecosystem that brings users together. The Mode team is clearly well aligned with our goals, so weâ€™re proud to announce that Mode will be our 27th blockchain ðŸŽ‰. Weâ€™re excited to be launching on Mode and offering users the optimal method for yield farming, a.k.a. The Beefy Way!
 
### Get Me There
